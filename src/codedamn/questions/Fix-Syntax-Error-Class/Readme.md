# Fix syntax errors - class

==============================

You have been provided with a class component called App. The component keeps track of a count value stored in its state and displays it to the user. The user should be able to increment the count by clicking on a button, however, the code contains some bugs that need to be fixed. Once the bugs have been fixed, the component should display the correct count value and log a message to the console only when the count value changes.

## challenges

- Renders the title, count, and button elements with the correct test IDs

- Starts with a count of 0

- Increments the count when the button is clicked
